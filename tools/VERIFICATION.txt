VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

The packaged ZIP archive is sourced via the project's page on Nir Sofer's website.
The project's page is located at the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/control_my_monitor.html

For convenience, the packaged archive was downloaded via the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/controlmymonitor.zip

Nir Sofer also publishes official checksums for the packaged archive at the following URL:
https://www.nirsoft.net/hash_check/?software=controlmymonitor

Note that the download URL is not versioned, and that the checksums page only contains information
for the latest available version. Therefore, these URLs will only be a valid reference source if
the latest available version and packaged version are one and the same. A newly released version
should be expected to invalidate a checksum verification for an older version when using these URLs.

As a workaround, this package's creation process includes the creation of historical snapshots via
the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to create a permanent backup source.
These snapshots can be accessed at the following URLs:

Download: https://web.archive.org/web/20230509234339/https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/controlmymonitor.zip
Checksums: https://web.archive.org/web/20230509234305/https://www.nirsoft.net/hash_check/?software=controlmymonitor

For convenience, the following checksums were published at the time of this package's creation:
MD5: 0822900b97a4ba10922fc4e71b377665
SHA1: 21ee8288c243dff780c977cc4f03725bdeb9caa8
SHA256: dccc8bb6db48e59dac7359d7e27f2c2601216945d5e574f6c8e5f349a58286bc
SHA512: 22d7c8b571acf6f33e537e38cbe98c1741eba5baa94c741174dcbc9b5335f6e84ab10334aadc4748d542636088ddf8bfc30f9528d70de2b704d932d97caaf675

Note that the MD5 and SHA1 hash algorithms are no longer considered secure by modern standards.
For tamper protection, it's recommended to validate against either a SHA256 or SHA512 hash instead.

The following PowerShell block will calculate and print a hash for each supported algorithm:

    $hashAlgorithms = @('MD5', 'SHA1', 'SHA256', 'SHA512')
    $hashAlgorithms | ForEach-Object { (Get-FileHash -Path controlmymonitor.zip -Algorithm $_).Hash.ToLower() }

This block should be executed against an independently downloaded archive, as well as the copy
distributed with the package. All of the calculated hash values should match the published checksums.
Matching hash values should confirm that the published checksums are valid, and that no corruption or
tampering has occurred during this package's generation process.
